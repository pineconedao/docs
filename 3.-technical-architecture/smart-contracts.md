# Smart Contracts

The technical architecture of the PineconeDAO platform is based on modern blockchain technology, using a layered design to achieve efficient collaboration among various functional modules. The following are the main components of the technical architecture:

## Infrastructure Layer

The infrastructure layer mainly includes blockchain networks (such as Ethereum, Polkadot, etc.) and distributed storage. This layer provides secure and reliable underlying support for the entire platform, ensuring data integrity and immutability.

## **Smart Contract Layer**

The smart contract layer is the core of the PineconeDAO platform, including PCT token contracts, Mystery Key NFT contracts, Blind Box NFT contracts, staking contracts, and lottery contracts, among others.
