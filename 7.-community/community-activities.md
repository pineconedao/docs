# Community Activities

To build an active and cohesive PineconeDAO community, the platform has designed a series of diverse community activities. These activities aim to stimulate user participation, enhance community cohesion, and promote the continuous development of the PineconeDAO platform.

#### Here are some major community activities:

1.  **Community Building Rewards**: Encouraging users to actively participate in community building by contributing content, suggestions, and feedback. Users can participate in community building by posting articles, sharing experiences, and providing improvement ideas. Active participants will receive platform rewards, such as PCT tokens and unique NFTs.


2.  **Referral System**: Users can earn rewards by inviting new users to join the platform. When invited users donate pine trees or purchase blind box NFTs, the inviter can receive a certain percentage of rewards. The referral system aims to attract more users to join the PineconeDAO community, thereby increasing the platform's popularity.


3.  **Regular Online Events**: PineconeDAO will regularly hold online events, such as AMA (Ask Me Anything) sessions, online lectures, and competitions. These events can help users better understand the platform, improve their skills, and have the opportunity to win generous rewards.


4.  **Governance Proposals**: As a decentralized autonomous organization, PineconeDAO encourages community members to submit governance proposals and participate in platform decision-making. In this way, community members can jointly promote the platform's development direction and policy formulation, ensuring PineconeDAO's long-term stability and prosperity.


5. **Special Events**: In addition to regular activities, PineconeDAO will occasionally launch special events, such as holiday celebrations and special themed events. These activities aim to enhance the community atmosphere and provide users with more entertainment and interaction opportunities.
