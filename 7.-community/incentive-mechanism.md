# Incentive Mechanism

The incentive mechanism of the PineconeDAO platform is a core component, aiming to attract and retain users, thereby promoting the healthy growth of the platform. PineconeDAO has outlined a series of incentive measures to meet the needs of different users:

1.  **Token Mining**: Users can earn platform tokens PCT as rewards by participating in various platform activities, such as trading, providing liquidity, or participating in community building. This will encourage users to actively engage in the platform ecosystem.


2.  **Liquidity Mining**: Users can add their tokens to the platform's liquidity pool, thus helping to improve the platform's liquidity. In return, they will receive a certain percentage of transaction fee income and PCT token rewards.


3.  **Referral Rewards**: Encouraging existing users to invite new users to join the platform. When the referred users generate transactions, participate in lottery events, etc., on the platform, the referrer will receive a certain percentage of rewards, such as PCT tokens or other forms of rewards. Referral rewards total 18%, divided into three levels: first level (50%), second level (30%), and third level (20%).


4.  **Community Building Rewards**: The platform will reward users who contribute to community building, such as providing valuable suggestions, solving problems, or participating in testing. These contributions will be considered as value creation for the platform and receive corresponding PCT token rewards.


5.  **Dividends for Holding PCT**: Users holding PCT tokens will be eligible to receive a portion of the platform's profits as dividends. Dividends can be distributed regularly or based on specific events or milestones. Users can earn rewards by staking PCT tokens, but the staking conditions must be director accounts.


6. **Governance Rights**: Users holding PCT tokens will gain platform governance rights and can participate in voting on key decisions, such as platform development direction and fee adjustments. This will make users more willing to actively participate in community governance and jointly promote the platform's development.
