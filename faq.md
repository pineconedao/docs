# FAQ

### Where will the funds be held?

We will use the same strategy as the Constitutional DAO for the initial fundraising for the PineconeDAO. We store funds in Gnosis multisig with some core contributors.

### What are the risks?

Cryptocurrency and web3 involve emerging fast-moving technologies and there is always the risk that unforeseen issues may affect us. While we strongly believe that we have made everything as safe and foolproof as possible given the time constraints, we believe it is important to inform the community of these possible risks:

1. Although we have many layers of protection, the Gnosis Multi-Sig wallet can be affected by theft, lost keys or fraud.
2. While these contracts have been thoroughly reviewed by the community, and our contribution platform has been battle-tested for millions of dollars before, there is always the possibility of smart contracts being hacked due to unknown vulnerabilities.

### Do I get ownership in exchange for my contribution?

No, you receive governance tokens, not fractional ownership. Governance includes the ability to advise on PineconeDAO's mission, values, and the ability to allocate resources to projects supported by the DAO. PineconeDAO is accepting donations and donors are receiving governance tokens. These donations are currently not tax deductible.

### How will governance work?

First, we will have proportional governance up to the limit determined by the community. As the DAO grows, our governance will mature and we may have more complex and decentralized governance structures - these decisions will be in the hands of $PCD holders.
