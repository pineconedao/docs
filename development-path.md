# Development path

### Phase 1: Deploy governance tokens for decentralized governance of PineconeDAO

**Our funding goal**: The main goal is to decentralize the governance of PineconeDAO, but in order to fund our project, we need funding.

In order to become a DAO, we need a governance token for decision making, which is our first step. The main purpose of this token is to decentralize governance, and at the same time, it can be freely traded on DeFi, and there is an opportunity to obtain airdropped game tokens.

It is very important to note that the core team did not pre-mine any tokens for themselves. We don't give "special terms" to any venture capitalists, influencers, angel investors, wealthy friends or family or anyone else. We are all treated equally.

Every investor, big or small, gets the same terms. No special treatment for anyone. This is unusual for the current project, but we thought it would be fairer for all involved that we didn't airdrop or premine any amount of tokens in advance. We are not VC funded, we are community organized and led, which is very important to us!

### Phase 2: development of on-chain games, airdrop game tokens to holders of governance tokens

We will actively develop the game, a metaverse game. The game will use AR technology to associate real-world positioning with the game world. Players can purchase land NFTs in the game world under a fair rule. It's more like a parallel universe concept, where players go to another virtual world.

Before the game goes live, game tokens will be airdropped to those who hold governance tokens, which can be used to purchase game NFT props and participate in the game. The game is designed in a P2E mode.

### Phase 3: Continue to strengthen the development of DAO to make the decentralized governance community more mature

Through joint efforts, the development of the DAO community will be more decentralized, and every decision will be decided by voting. The future of DAO depends on each community member, not a group.
