# Development Path

**Phase 1: Deploy governance token PCT for decentralized governance of PineconeDAO** In the first phase, we will deploy PCT (Pinecone Token) as the governance token for PineconeDAO, realizing the platform's decentralized governance. PCT tokens will grant community members voting rights, allowing them to participate in platform decisions, ensuring a fair, transparent, and open management process. Features of PCT token:

* **Decentralized governance**: Users holding PCT tokens can participate in PineconeDAO's governance, including proposals, discussions, and voting. This ensures that the direction of platform development and major decisions are collectively determined by community members.
* **Dividend rights**: PCT token holders will enjoy the right to share platform profits. The platform will distribute a portion of its profits to PCT token holders, allowing them to share in PineconeDAO's growth.
* **Invitation rewards**: PCT tokens will support invitation rewards, totaling 18% of the rewards. Users who invite new members to join the platform will receive corresponding rewards, incentivizing community members to actively promote and expand the community.
* **Staking for director dividends**: Users can stake their PCT tokens on the platform to enjoy director dividends. This will provide users with a stable source of income and encourage them to hold PCT tokens for the long term.

It is worth emphasizing that the core team has not pre-mined any PCT tokens for themselves, ensuring equal treatment for all participants. We will adopt a fair and transparent issuance method, providing the same terms for investors, users, and community members, ensuring the long-term stability and sustainable development of the PineconeDAO platform.

**Phase 4: Continuously strengthen DAO development, making decentralized governance community more mature** We will continue to work towards achieving the decentralization of the DAO community, ensuring that every decision is made through voting. This will enable community members to jointly drive the platform's development, rather than being led by a particular group. In this phase, we will continuously improve the governance structure
