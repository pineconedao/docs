**Disclaimer**: We provide this information because we believe it will help build trust and allow our name and reputation to support this effort. However, we don't claim to be the "leader" of this DAO, we just help guide it in its early life and then, like proud parents, run free once it matures.

Decentralized Autonomous Organization, every token holder is part of our team, and we have driven it through the community from the very beginning.
