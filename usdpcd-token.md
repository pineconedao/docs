# $PCD token

The $PCD governance coin will launch in early 2022.

### How to buy $PCD

Trading pairs will be available on https://uniswap.org/ after the initial raise.&#x20;

### Distribution & Token Economics

1. Our tokens have a fixed supply, with a total supply of 10 billion. Once our initial token raise is over, we will never increase the supply of tokens.
2. Our tokens will be used for governance decisions. We will have proportional governance until the community decides. Some restrictions are needed so that if someone buys more than 51% of the tokens, they also cannot centrally control the DAO's decisions.
3. The donated funds will be divided into 2 parts. The first part accounts for 30% to support P2E game development and future promotion; the second part accounts for 70% as a reserve to support the value of tokens
4. Donation collection will be conducted on juicebox.money and pineconedao.com, and for each contribution, we will create governance tokens at a fixed rate. You will receive these tokens in your wallet to participate in community decision governance for voting.
5. During the donation process, we can get the governance token $PCD, as well as airdrop game tokens in the future, which can be used to purchase NFT props in the game, etc.
