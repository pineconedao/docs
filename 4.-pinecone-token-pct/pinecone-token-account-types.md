# Pinecone Token Account Types

**Standard Account**: This account type is the most basic account type, where users can use the account to trade and transfer Pinecone Tokens. Standard accounts do not have special privileges or functions.

**Genesis Account**: This account type is the initial account for Pinecone Tokens, with the authority to upgrade. Genesis accounts can be upgraded to Pine Tree or Director accounts, serving as the exclusive channel for account upgrades.

**Pine Tree Account**: This account type is designed for long-term holders of Pinecone Tokens. Pine Tree accounts can obtain PCT through mining by donating a lower amount. In addition, Pine Tree accounts can also participate in the governance and decision-making of Pinecone Tokens.

**Director Account**: This account type is designed for core members of Pinecone Tokens. Director accounts can participate in the governance and decision-making of Pinecone Tokens and have staking rights. By staking, Director accounts can obtain additional dividend income, encouraging them to contribute to the development of Pinecone Tokens.

To upgrade an account, a Standard Account must first be converted into a Genesis Account. There are currently two ways to achieve this:

1. Accept an invitation or referral from a Pine Tree or Director account holder.
2. Discover the hidden feature in the blind box. Opening the blind box will automatically convert a Standard Account into a Genesis Account.

Once a Genesis Account is obtained, it can be upgraded to a Pine Tree or Director Account. Additionally, when the number of Pine Trees in a Pine Tree Account reaches 30, the account will automatically be upgraded to a Director Account.

Please note that any future changes to the account upgrade process will be communicated accordingly, and the platform's features will determine the final process.
