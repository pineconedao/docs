# Frequently Asked Questions(FAQ)

#### Q: Where will the funds be stored?&#x20;

A: We will use the same strategy as ConstitutionDAO for the initial fundraising of **PineconeDAO**. We will store the funds in a Gnosis multi-signature wallet, which includes some core contributors.

#### Q: What are the risks?&#x20;

A: Cryptocurrency and web3 involve emerging, rapidly developing technologies, and there are always unforeseeable issues that may affect our risks. While we strongly believe that, given the time constraints, we have made everything as secure and foolproof as possible, we think it's important to inform the community of these potential risks:

* Despite having multiple layers of protection, the Gnosis Multi-Sig wallet may be subject to theft, lost keys, or fraud.
* Although the community has thoroughly audited these contracts and our contribution platform has previously been battle-tested with millions of dollars, smart contracts are always susceptible to hacking due to unknown vulnerabilities.

#### Q: Do I receive ownership in exchange for my contribution?&#x20;

A: No, you receive governance tokens, not partial ownership. Governance includes the ability to provide input on PineconeDAO's mission and values, as well as the ability to allocate resources to projects supported by the DAO. PineconeDAO is accepting donations, and donors are receiving governance tokens. These donations are currently not tax-deductible.

#### Q: How will governance work?&#x20;

A: Initially, we will have proportional governance until the community decides on limitations. As the DAO evolves, our governance will mature, and we may have more complex, decentralized governance structures â€“ these decisions will be in the hands of **PCT holders**.
